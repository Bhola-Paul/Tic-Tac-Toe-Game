This repository contains the code for a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players alternate turns placing their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

The game features a clean and intuitive user interface. The code is well-structured and easy to understand, making it a great project for learning web development fundamentals.
